# StackOverFlow2023SurveyAnalysis

# Installation
Other than the anaconda distribution of Python, There are not any required libraries to run the code. The code should run with no issues using Python version 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey results from 2023 to better understand:
  1. what is the highest paying industry
  2. which countries have the highest full-time employment and which have the least.
  3. what are the most and least common ways used by respondents to learn how to code

# StackOverFlow2023SurveyAnalysis

# Installation
Other than the anaconda distribution of Python, There are not any required libraries to run the code. The code should run with no issues using Python version 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey results from 2023 to better understand:
  1. what are the most and least common ways to learn how to code in each age group?
  2. what are the most used platforms to learn how to code
  3. can we predict DevType?
     
# File Descriptions

Markdown cells were used to help viewers navigate through the different steps.

# Results
The results of my analysis can be found at the post available [here]().
